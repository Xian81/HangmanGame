An example of the game Hangman can be found [here](https://www.hangmanwords.com/play), if you aren't familiar with it. The basic idea of the game is that you have to guess the letters to a random word, with a limit of incorrect guesses you are allowed. For each incorrect guess, a limb is added to the 'hangman'. When the 'hangman' is completed, you have run out of guesses and you lose a game. \n","\n","A program which plays a game of hangman must therefore choose a random word and loop through the following actions:\n","\n","- Get an input from the user, validate that it is a letter and that it has not been guessed already.\n","- Store the letters guessed so far.\n","- Count the number of incorrect letters guessed.\n","- Print out the current state of the game, including: the hangman graphic, the word with unguessed letters replaced with underscores, and the letters already guessed.\n","- Check whether the game has finished by running out of guesses or completely guessing the word, printing out the outcome.\n","\n","\n","An example output of a game halfway through would be:\n","\n","      +-----+\n","      |     |\n","      O     |\n","     /|     |\n","            |\n","            |\n","            |\n","    ==========\n","    Word: _ic_i__\n","    Guessed: b, c, h, i, v\n","\n","We have provided a file called `wordlist.txt` which contains 1000 words, so the random word can be taken from these. We have also written a function called `print_graphics` which takes the number of `wrong_guesses` and prints out the current state of the hangman. It accepts integers between 0 and 6, meaning the game ends when the user makes 6 incorrect guesses. We have also included the import of a function called `clear_output()`, you can use this each game loop iteration to clear the current output, meaning you can print the state of the game in the same place each loop.\n","\n","This may seem difficult to implement at first, however if you break the task down into each section required and implement those individually you'll be able to complete the program. This process of breaking down a task is a core concept required when writing complex programs to solve a task. We have provided a set of comments aimed to help you understand how the program could be broken down, however you don't need to stick to this structure. If you don't understand the structure of the program required, feel free to ask a mentor or ask PDs (e.g. on Slack).\n","\n","\n","If you complete the program before midnight on 31st of January, you'll receive feedback and a certificate of completion and you may win a prize for the best submission. \n","\n","May the force be with you! :) "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2h0uOqhRspp2","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1611000694775,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":33765,"user":{"displayName":"Christian Howard","photoUrl":"","userId":"05838259047617383671"}},"outputId":"c6bea532-fa1b-4fb9-85eb-abbd06ec81ce"},"source":["# imports\n","from IPython.display import clear_output\n","from google.colab import files\n","import random\n","\n","\n","''' \n","    Print the graphics for the hangman game,\n","    takes the number of incorrect guesses in range 0-6\n","'''      \n","def print_graphics(wrong_guesses):\n","    #
